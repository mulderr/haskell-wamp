# haskell-wamp

A very experimental Haskell implementation of the Web Application Messaging Protocol v2 Basic Profile.

Official specification available [here](https://github.com/tavendo/WAMP/blob/master/spec/basic.md).

For a sample WAMP *Router* using [wai-websockets](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/wai-websockets) see examples.

*Warning:* as of right now this is nothing more than an incomplete rough sketch.
